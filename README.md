# Trade blotter

The goal of this project is to consume a trade blotter for a portfolio
and calculate various financial metrics, chiefly the profit made (or
loss taken).

A trade blotter contains a record of all trades that were executed on an
exchange (also called a 'fill') for a given portfolio. Each line in the
trade blotter provides the details of a fill.

For the purposes of this exercise, please assume that we are starting
with a completely empty portfolio (i.e., the portfolio consists only of
stocks acquired by trades in the trade blotter).

Data Format
-----------

The format of the blotter is a CSV file that contains the following
fields:

LocalTime,Symbol,EventType,Side,FillSize,FillPrice,FillExchange

9:30:00.000,AES,TRADE,t,100,11.14,NYSE

9:30:01.000,AES,TRADE,b,100,11.16,NASDAQ

9:30:02.000,CX,TRADE,b,100,7.5,NASDAQ

9:30:03.000,CX,TRADE,t,100,7.51,NASDAQ

9:30:04.000,CX,TRADE,b,200,7.5,NASDAQ

Fields Description
------------------

The following describes each of the columns:

1.  LocalTime (string): Time of the order event in HH:MM:SS.millisecs
2.  Symbol (string): Stock ticker
3.  EventType: The specific event type
    -   This project is only concerned with the TRADE events
4.  Side (b\|s\|t): Tells whether the original order is a buy, sell, or
    short sell order
    -   b: Buy
    -   s: Sell
    -   t: Short sell
        -   For this project, you can treat Short Sell orders as Sell
            orders
5.  FillSize (unsigned integer): Number of shares that were filled
6.  FillPrice (double): Price at which the trade was executed
7.  FillExchange (string): Name of exchange where the trade was filled


PROJECT DEFINITION
==================

Write a python script that consumes the above CSV file and produces an
enriched version of the CSV file with the additional columns described
below.

The python script should be callable in the following ways:

1.  From the command line via:

```{bash}
calcStats.py --inputFile=trades.csv --outputFile=enrichedTrades.csv
```

2.  By importing it and calling:

```{bash}
    from calcStats import calcTradeStats

    calcTradeStats(inputFile, outputFile)
```

The inputFile is a CSV file in the format described above.


The output is composed of two components:

1.  An enriched version of the input CSV file which adds the columns
    described below to the original file and populates it on a
    trade-by-trade basis
2.  A summary of relevant statistics as described below

 

Enriched Version Columns
------------------------

The output should be an enriched version of the input CSV file which
adds the following columns to the original file and populates it on
a **trade-by-trade** basis:

(note the list of additional columns starts at 'h' to denote their
location at the end of the line).
 

0.  SymbolBought
    -   Number of shares of the stock bought
1.  SymbolSold
    -   Number of shares of the stock sold
2.  SymbolPosition
    -   Number of shares of a stock the portfolio currently holds or
        owes
    -   Dependent on the number of shares we bought vs. sold, the
        position can be:
        1.  Long (positive number) if we bought more shares than we sold
        2.  Short (negative number) if we sold more than we bought
        3.  Flat (zero) if we do not have a position in the given stock
3.  SymbolNotional
    -   Value of the shares bought or sold, == FillSize \* FilledPrice
4.  ExchangeBought
    -   Number of shares bought on the current exchange, across all
        symbols
5.  ExchangeSold
    -   Number of shares sold on the current exchange, across all
        symbols
6.  TotalBought
    -   Total number of shares bought across all symbols
7.  TotalSold
    -   Total number of shares sold across all symbols
8.  TotalBoughtNotional
    -   Total value (SymbolNotional) of all shares bought across all
        symbols
9.  TotalSoldNotional
    -   Total value (SymbolNotional) of all shares sold across all
        symbols


The following is enriched output for the sample data in the Data Format
section above:
